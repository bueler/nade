## Project

  * Read this first: [your Math 615 Project (PDF)](assets/project/S25/your-project.pdf)
  * You can use this optional [example LaTeX file for your project (.tex)](assets/project/S25/blankproject.tex).  See the [PDF it produces](assets/project/S25/blankproject.pdf).
  * Here is the [feedback and grading rubric (PDF)](assets/project/S25/rubric.pdf) I will use twice, first for the Proposal and then for the completed Project.
