---

# WARNING: UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND WITH BROKEN LINKS!!

Welcome to the public homepage of **Math F615 Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations**, Spring 2025, in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

#### Instructor:  [Ed Bueler](http://bueler.github.io/)

Email me at [elbueler@alaska.edu](mailto:elbueler@alaska.edu).  I hold [office hours](http://bueler.github.io/OffHrs.htm) in Chapman 306C.

### Canvas course page

Log in to [canvas.alaska.edu/courses/24194](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/24194) for the Zoom lecture link, Homework and Exam solutions, and to see your grades.

### Getting Started

* Attend lectures: MWF 3:30--4:30pm in Chapman 107, and synchronously online.

* Read the [Syllabus (PDF)](assets/general/S25/syllabus.pdf).

* See the [Schedule (PDF)](assets/general/S25/schedule.pdf).  Check it often for due dates, and for which topics come next!

* Check out the near-weekly [homework Assignments](homework.html).

* There are two Exams, a Midterm and a Final.  Both are in class, and the Final will happen at the scheduled time.  See the [Exams](exams.html) tab for review guides.

* You will do a Project on a topic of your choice, starting with a Proposal.  Please read the materials on the [Project](project.html) tab before you turn in anything.

* Homework and projects will require some programming in Matlab/Octave or some other suitable scientific computing language.  See the [Computing](computing.html) tab and [_Programming languages compared_ (PDF)](https://bueler.github.io/compareMOP.pdf) for recommended languages.
