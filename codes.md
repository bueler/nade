# Matlab/Octave Codes

## from lecture

  * [heat.m](assets/codes/heat.m) solves time-dependent heat equation in 1D
  * [heattogif.m](assets/codes/heattogif.m) animates [heat.m](assets/codes/heat.m) result to give [this GIF](assets/codes/figs/heat.gif)
  * [steadyheat.m](assets/codes/steadyheat.m) solves u''(x) = f(x) with Dirichlet boundary conditions
  * [verifysh.m](assets/codes/verifysh.m) generates [this convergence figure](assets/codes/figs/verifysh.png)
  * [bothneumann.m](assets/codes/bothneumann.m) solves u''(x) = f(x) with Neumann boundary conditions
  * [heat2d.m](assets/codes/heat2d.m) solves u_xx + u_yy = f on a square, with mixed boundary conditions
  * [testheat2d](assets/codes/testheat2d.m) calls [heat2d.m](assets/codes/heat2d.m) to demonstrate convergence
  * [eulerboth.m](assets/codes/eulerboth.m) generates 3 figures for different step sizes k: [k=1](assets/codes/figs/eulerbothone.png) and [k=0.5,0.2](assets/codes/figs/eulerbothsmaller.png) and [k=0.1,0.05](assets/codes/figs/eulerbothgood.png)
  * [taylor2.m](assets/codes/taylor2.m) Taylor O(k^2) method; generates [this figure](assets/codes/figs/taylor2.png)
  * [rungekutta.m](assets/codes/rungekutta.m) compare O(k^1), O(k^2), and O(k^4) Runge-Kutta methods; generates [this figure](assets/codes/figs/rungekutta.png)
  * [stepsizes.m](assets/codes/stepsizes.m) show time step sizes generated by Matlab's adaptive and embedded Runge-Kutta methods [ode23](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode23.html) and [ode45](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode45.html); Octave generates [this expected figure](assets/codes/figs/stepsizes_octave.png) while Matlab generates [this weird result](assets/codes/figs/stepsizes_matlab.png)
  * [heatblackbox.m](assets/codes/heatblackbox.m) advertise MOL approach to heat equation PDE with this short code which calls `ode23`; generates [this figure](assets/codes/figs/heatblackbox.png)
  * [refinestable.py](assets/codes/refinestable.py) **[Python]** generates `.png` figures showing conditional stability for FTCS on the heat equation; here are [the figures rolled into an animated `.gif`](assets/codes/refinestable.gif)
