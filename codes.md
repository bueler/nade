# Matlab/Octave Codes

## from lecture

  * [heat.m](assets/codes/heat.m) solves time-dependent heat equation in 1D
  * [heattogif.m](assets/codes/heattogif.m) animates [heat.m](assets/codes/heat.m) result to give [this GIF](assets/codes/heat.gif)
  * [steadyheat.m](assets/codes/steadyheat.m) solves u''(x) = f(x) with Dirichlet boundary conditions
  * [verifysh.m](assets/codes/verifysh.m) generates [this convergence figure](assets/codes/verifysh.png)
  * [bothneumann.m](assets/codes/bothneumann.m) solves u''(x) = f(x) with Neumann boundary conditions
  * [heat2d.m](assets/codes/heat2d.m) solves u_xx + u_yy = f on a square, with mixed boundary conditions
  * [testheat2d](assets/codes/testheat2d.m) calls [heat2d.m](assets/codes/heat2d.m) to demonstrate convergence
