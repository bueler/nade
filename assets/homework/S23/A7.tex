Please read textbook\footnote{R.~J.~LeVeque, \emph{Finite Difference Methods for Ordinary and Partial Diff.~Eqns.}, SIAM Press 2007} Chapters 6 and 7.  Within this material we are de-emphasizing the discussion of multistep methods, so full understanding of sections 5.9, 6.4, 7.3, and 7.6.1 is not expected.  Basically, full understanding of the other sections \emph{is} expected.  In any case, \emph{actually reading} these Chapters is going to be important to success on this and later Assignments.

\prob{Problem P30.}  Consider the ``$\theta$-methods'' for $u' = f(t,u)$, namely
   $$U^{n+1} = U^n + k\Big[(1-\theta)f(t_n,U^n) + \theta f(t_{n+1},U^{n+1})\Big],$$
where $0\le \theta \le 1$ is a fixed parameter.\footnote{Note that I did all parts of this problem \textbf{P30} by hand.}

\epart{a} Cases $\theta = 0,1/2,1$ are all familiar methods.  Name them.

\epart{b} Find the (absolute) stability regions for $\theta = 0,1/4,1/2,3/4,1$.  (\emph{Hint.}  Write the complex number $z=k\lambda$ as $z=x+iy$.  Find the circles!)

\epart{c} Show that the $\theta$-methods are A-stable for $\theta \geq 1/2$.


\prob{Problem P31.}  Consider this Runge-Kutta method, a one-step and implicit interpretation of the multistep midpoint method:
\begin{align*}
U^* &= U^n + \frac{k}{2} f\big(t_n + k/2, U^*\big),\\
U^{n+1} &= U^n + k f\big(t_n + k/2, U^*\big).
\end{align*}
The first stage is backward Euler to determine an approximation to the value at the midpoint in time.  The second stage is a midpoint method using this value.

\epart{a}  Determine the order of accuracy of this method.  That is, compute the truncation error accurately enough to know the power $p$ in $\tau=O(k^p)$.

\epart{b}  Determine the stability region.  Is this method A-stable?  Is it L-stable?


\prob{Problem P32.}  Reproduce Table 7.1.  In particular, consider the scalar ODE IVP
	$$u'(t) = \lambda \left( u(t) - \cos(t) \right) - \sin(t), \qquad u(0)=1,$$
with the particular value $\lambda=-2100$.  Use an implementation of forward Euler, for example from your or my solutions to \textbf{Assignment \#6}, to compute approximations of $u(T)$ for $T=2$, for the given values of $k$, and report the final-time numerical errors $|U^N - u(T)|$ as in the Table.  Confirm by this experiment\footnote{Of course, the book explains the effect logically, which is the major point of Chapter 7, at least as it applies to forward Euler: $|1+k\lambda| \le 1$ only if $k|\lambda|<2$ or equivalently $k < 2/|\lambda| = 2/2100 = 0.00095238$.} that there is a critical value of $k$ around 0.00095 where the error finally drops from enormous values to something comparable to, then much smaller than, the solution magnitude itself.



\begin{comment} MOVE THE FOLLOWING TO A8 or A8
\prob{Problem PYY.}  Subsection 5.9.4 explains why the explicit trapezoid rule (5.53) is sometimes called a \emph{predictor-corrector} method.  A full Euler step is used to estimate (``predict'') the new solution value, and then a formerly-implicit method, the original trapezoid method, is used to actually take the step, which ``corrects'' the prediction.  This problem attempts to construct a predictor-corrector method with higher order.

\epart{a}  On page 132 (section 5.9) there is a list of explicit Adams-Bashforth and implicit Adams-Moulton multistep methods.  Suppose we cut a step into two parts, with stage steps $k/2$.  From $U^n$ suppose we take a  forward Euler step of length $k/2$ to give $U^*$ at $t_n+k/2$.  Then we use $U^n$ and $U^*$ in the second-order (``2-step'') Adams-Bashforth scheme to give $U^\dagger$ at $t_n+k=t_{n+1}$.  The value $U^\dagger$ is the predicted value at $t_{n+1}$.  Then we use the second-order (``2-step'') Adams-Moulton scheme, using known values $U^n,U^*,U^\dagger$ on the right-hand side, as the corrector to give $U^{n+1}$.  Write down these formulas.  (You don't need to implement this scheme, but your formulas should make it clear how to do so.)

\epart{b}  The scheme you constructed in part \textbf{(a)} is a one-step, multi-stage Runge-Kutta scheme.  Write down its Butcher tableau.  (\emph{Hint.}  Be careful!  You really can write the scheme in form (5.34), where $Y_1=U^n$, $Y_2=U^*$, $Y_3=U^\dagger$.)

\epart{c}  Following what is described at the beginning of section 7.6.2, apply the scheme in part \textbf{(a)} to the test equation $u'=\lambda u$ and write the scheme as $U^{n+1} = R(z) U^n$ for $z=\lambda k$.  What is $R(z)$?  From the form of $R(z)$, what is the order of the truncation error?  (That is, what is $p$ in $\tau=O(k^p)$?)  Would you recommend this method?

\epart{d} Generate a plot of the stability region of the method; see the advice in section 7.6.2 on how to do this.

\prob{Problem P33.}  For a famously stiff problem, consider the heat PDE
\begin{equation}
u_t = u_{xx}  \label{heat}
\end{equation}
Here $u(t,x)$ is the temperature in a rod of length one ($0 \le x \le 1$) and we set boundary temperatures to zero ($u(t,0)=0$ and $u(t,1)=0$).  For an initial temperature distribution we set one part hotter than the rest:
    $$u(0,x) = \begin{cases} 1, & 0.25 < x < 0.5, \\
                             0, & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}$$
Suppose we seek $u(1,x)$, i.e.~we set $t_f = 1$.

We apply the \emph{method of lines} (MOL) to \eqref{heat}.  That is, we discretize the spatial ($x$) derivatives using the notation from Chapter 2.  Specifically, use $m+1$ subintervals, let $h=1/(m+1)$, and let $x_j = j h$ for $j=0,1,2,\dots,m+1$.  Now $U_j(t) \approx u(t,x_j)$.  By eliminating unknowns $U_0=0$ and $U_{m+1}=0$, and keeping the time derivatives as ordinary derivatives, from \eqref{heat} we get a linear ODE system of dimension $m$,
\begin{equation}
U(t)' = A U(t)  \label{mol}
\end{equation}
where $U(t) \in \RR^m$ and $A$ is \emph{exactly} the matrix in the textbook's equation (2.10).  For a given $m$, note $U(0)$ is computed from the above formula for $u(0,x)$.

\epart{a}  Implement both forward and backward Euler on \eqref{mol}.  For BE, store $A$ using \texttt{sparse} storage and solve the equation using backslash or another linear solver which will automatically detect that the matrix is tridiagonal and solve it efficiently.

\epart{b}  Now consider the $m=99$ case, so $h=0.01$, and let $k=t_f/N=1/N$ be the time step length.  For BE, compute and show the solution using $N=100$ time steps.  For FE, $N=100$ will generate extraordinary explosion.  (Confirm this but don't show it.)  Determine the largest-possible absolutely-stable time step $k$ from the eigenvalues of $A$ and the stability region of FE.  Finally, compare the computational costs of the two runs by counting floating-point multiplications.\footnote{For an $m\times m$ tridiagonal matrix $A$, $A v$ costs $3m$ multiplications while $A^{-1} v$ costs $5m$ multiplications.}  You will conclude that an implicit is indeed effective in this case.

\epart{1 point of extra credit}  Find the exact solution, presumably using a Fourier sine series.  Plot it beside the $N=100$ BE solution.  BE looks pretty good on this problem!
